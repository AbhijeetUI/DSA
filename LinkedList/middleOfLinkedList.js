/**
 * 
 * Two pointers:
- slow â†’ moves 1 step at a time
- fast â†’ moves 2 steps at a time

Linked List: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 5 â†’ NULL
Expected Middle: Node with value 3

Initialize:
- slow = head (node 1)
- fast = head (node 1)

--- Iteration 1 ---
- Move slow to 2
- Move fast to 3

Current:
- slow â†’ 2
- fast â†’ 3

--- Iteration 2 ---
- Move slow to 3
- Move fast to 5

Current:
- slow â†’ 3
- fast â†’ 5

--- Iteration 3 ---
- fast.next is NULL â†’ loop stops

ðŸŽ¯ Result:
- slow is at node 3 â†’ middle node found

 Notes:
- If the list has an odd length, slow lands exactly in the center.
- If it's even, it returns the second middle node, which is often preferred in interview problems unless stated otherwise.
